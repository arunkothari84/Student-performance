# Student-performance
Finding the feature which can help us predict the reading score of the student, and trying to predict the reading of score of other student.




EXPLAIN:
After importing all the libraries, I plot the scatter graph between writing skills and reading skills. And the graph came linear hence proving the reading skill is depended on the writing skill of the student.

I calculated slope and intersept using the function define(There is no use of them, I thoughtof putting here because it took me time to find a method to find slope of such graph so I thought putting here will give extra knowledge)

later i use linear regression and mean squared error for finding the accuracy.
